---

A **full-stack task management system** built as part of academic exploration and self-learning in  **Software Development** . This project demonstrates end-to-end application development using modern technologies and best practices.

### ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

* **Frontend** : React.js, Bootstrap (UI styling), CSS
* **Backend** : Spring Boot (Java), Spring Data JPA, Maven
* **Database** : MySQL (task storage, persistence)
* **API Communication** : REST APIs (JSON-based CRUD operations)

### ðŸ”¹ Features Implemented

* **Add Tasks** â†’ Users can create tasks with title, description, and time.
* **Delete Tasks** â†’ Tasks are removed from both database and UI instantly.
* **Mark Complete / Incomplete** â†’ Strike-through + checkbox toggle, persisted in MySQL.
* **Expandable Descriptions** â†’ Only first few words are shown; clicking expands smoothly to show full details.
* **Modal-Based Task Creation** â†’ Pop-up dialog box with inputs for task details and scrollable time wheels (hour, minute, AM/PM).
* **Responsive UI** â†’ Bootstrap-styled interface, mobile-friendly layout.

### ðŸ”¹ Enhancements in Progress

* Duplicate task prevention.
* Task editing & updating.
* Sorting & filtering (Pending, Completed, All).
* Notifications & user authentication (future scope).

### ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes

* Practical exposure to  **full-stack development** .
* Hands-on experience integrating  **React frontend with Spring Boot REST APIs** .
* Strong understanding of **CRUD operations, state management, and persistence** in MySQL.
* Improved UI/UX with  **Bootstrap components and smooth animations** .
